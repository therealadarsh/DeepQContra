# Reinforcement Learning using Deep Q Learning on Contra

This repository is about implementing the reinforcement learning algorithm Deep Q Learning on the game of Contra. To interact with Contra, we are using OpenAI- Gym.

## Installation

### Installation Requirements
We created an virtual environment to work with the project with all the libraries installed. To activate the virtual environment on python 3.6,
The virtual environment is installed in folder /env that has all the supporting libraries installed.
```
source env/bin/activate
```

### Usage

```
python -m randomAgent --game ContraForce-Nes
